Please fix any errors in the code above.

You will output the content of each new or changed.
Represent files like so:

{FILENAME}
```
{CODE}
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
{FILENAME} is the lowercase combined path and file name includng the file extension
{CODE} is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/index.html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
